# hello-world
I'm a 31 year old newbie programmer living in Hong Kong. I've worked for 8 years in the finance industry, as a journalist, private banker, and equity research analyst. I'm currently trading options for my own account and learning to code so I can make my trading system more quantitative and automated.
